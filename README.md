# Heap_Leetcode

This repository contains solutions and explanations for popular heap-related problems from LeetCode. The goal is to build a strong understanding of heap data structures (Min-Heap and Max-Heap) and apply them to solve real-world algorithmic challenges.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- âœ… Fundamentals of Heaps (Min-Heap vs Max-Heap)
- âœ… Heap Operations: `heappush`, `heappop`, `heapify`
- âœ… Common patterns using heaps:
  - Top K elements
  - Merge multiple sorted lists
  - Streaming median
  - Sliding window problems

## ðŸš€ LeetCode Problems Included
1. **Merge K Sorted Lists** (LeetCode 23)  
   - Uses Min-Heap to merge k linked lists efficiently.
2. **Top K Frequent Elements** (LeetCode 347)  
   - Uses Min-Heap to keep track of the most frequent elements.
3. **Find Median from Data Stream** (LeetCode 295)  
   - Implements two-heap approach for dynamic median calculation.
4. **Kth Largest Element in an Array** (LeetCode 215)  
   - Maintains a Min-Heap of size k to find the kth largest element.
5. **Sliding Window Median** (LeetCode 480)  
   - Uses a combination of heaps and lazy deletion to calculate medians.
